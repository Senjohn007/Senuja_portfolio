🚀 Excited to share my Personal Portfolio Website!

I’ve built a full-stack dynamic portfolio using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) + Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase my projects, skills, achievements, and provide a professional contact hub.

Key Highlights:

Projects & Skills: Dynamically fetched from MongoDB with interactive cards and filters

Achievements & Certifications: Timeline and badges with certificate links

Contact Form: Messages saved to DB + email notifications

CV Download: Easily accessible PDF

Admin Panel: Secure JWT-protected dashboard to manage projects, skills, achievements, and visitor messages

Modern UI/UX: Responsive design, dark mode, Framer Motion animations, hover effects, and mobile-first layout

This project combines full-stack development, database integration, REST API design, and modern frontend practices into a single portfolio that also acts as a mini CMS.
