Phase 4 – Frontend Layout & Routing
Setup routing and layout:

Use react-router-dom:

/ – Home (all sections as scrollable).

/projects/:id – detailed project page.

/admin/login

/admin/dashboard (+ nested sub‑pages).

Create layout components:

Navbar, Footer, SectionWrapper (for consistent padding, max‑width).

Global styling:

Define Tailwind config theme (colors, fonts).

Use a consistent max‑width container (e.g. max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4).

Implement smooth scrolling and section IDs.

Dark / light mode:

Use Tailwind’s dark mode with a dark class on html or body.

Use a React context hook for theme and a toggle button in navbar.

Phase 5 – Core Public Sections
Home / Hero section:

Elements:

Name, role (e.g., “Software Engineering Undergraduate | Full‑Stack & Cloud Enthusiast”).

Short 1–2 line intro.

Buttons: “Download CV”, “View Projects”, “Contact Me”.

Use Framer Motion for:

Fade‑in on load.

Animated text or subtle entrance of elements.
​

Tailwind for responsive layout (stack vertically on mobile, side‑by‑side on desktop).

About section:

Content:

Brief story (who you are, what you enjoy building).

Education (SLIIT, batch, specialization).

A simple timeline (Tailwind flex/vertical border) to show milestones.

Include a small photo (hosted via Cloudinary or in /public).

Skills section:

Fetch from /api/skills.

Group by category (Frontend / Backend / Tools / Data).

Design:

Cards or chips with icons (React Icons).

Optional progress bars for proficiency.

Use responsive grid: grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4.

Projects section:

Fetch from /api/projects.

Cards show:

Title, short description, tech stack badges.

Buttons: “Live Demo”, “GitHub”.

Thumbnail image.

Filtering:

Local state activeFilter='All'.

Filter buttons (All / Web / Data / Mobile etc.) – filter client‑side.

Add subtle hover effects and Framer Motion on scroll.

Project detail page:

Route /projects/:id.

Fetch a single project from /api/projects/:id.

Show:

Problem → Solution narrative.

Features list.

Tech stack.

Challenges & learnings.

This page demonstrates your engineering thinking, not just UI.

Achievements & certifications:

Fetch from /api/achievements.

Display as cards or timeline:

Title, issuer, date, description, link to certificate image.

Use badges for types (Competition / Certification / Academic).

CV download:

Upload a PDF to backend or storage.

Simple approach:

Put cv.pdf in backend public folder and expose /files/cv.

Frontend button simply hits that URL with download attribute.

Optionally track with a POST /api/analytics/cv-download that increments a counter.

Contact section:

Form fields: name, email, message.

Validate on frontend.

Submit to /api/messages.

Show success or error UI.

Optionally integrate Google reCAPTCHA v2 or v3.

Footer:

Include:

LinkedIn, GitHub, email, maybe Kaggle, LeetCode, etc.

Use React Icons (e.g., FaGithub, FaLinkedin).

Ensure mobile‑friendly spacing and big tap targets.

Phase 6 – Admin Frontend (Dashboard)
Admin login:

/admin/login:

Form: email, password.

On success, store JWT in localStorage or httpOnly cookie (cookie is safer).

Protect routes:

Custom PrivateRoute component that checks token and redirects to login.

Dashboard layout:

/admin/dashboard with sidebar:

Menu: Projects, Achievements, Skills, Messages, Settings.

Use a simple Tailwind layout with responsive drawer on mobile.

CRUD interfaces:

Each section:

List view (table or cards).

Add / Edit form.

On save:

Call corresponding /api/admin/* endpoint with JWT.

Messages page:

List messages, mark as read, view full content.

Deployment configuration later:

Plan environment variables:

VITE_API_BASE_URL in frontend.

MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS, CLOUDINARY_* in backend.

Phase 7 – Polishing UI/UX
Responsiveness:

Test breakpoints:

Mobile: 360–420 width.

Tablet: ~768.

Laptop: 1024+.

Fix any overflow using Tailwind utilities:

flex-wrap, overflow-hidden, truncate, etc.

Micro‑interactions:

Add hover animations to buttons and cards.

Use Framer Motion for:

Section fade‑ins when scrolling.

Slight tilt/scale of project cards on hover.

Keep animations subtle; avoid hurting readability.
​

Optional advanced features:

GitHub API:

Server route that fetches your pinned repos or latest projects and caches them.

Blog:

Simple /api/posts with markdown content.

Render with a markdown library in React.

Analytics:

Use a free analytics tool (e.g., plausible, simple GA) or track simple counts in MongoDB.

Phase 8 – Deployment
Backend:

Host on Render / Railway:

Push /server to GitHub.

Configure:

Node version.

npm start or node src/index.js.

Set environment variables in dashboard.
​

Database:

MongoDB Atlas cluster (free tier).

Whitelist Render / Railway IP or allow “Anywhere” with strong credentials.

Frontend:

Deploy /client on Vercel or Netlify:

Connect GitHub repo.

Build command: npm run build.

Set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your backend URL.

Domain:

Buy a .dev or .me domain.

Point DNS to Vercel/Netlify.

Ensure HTTPS.
